This is an alternative firmware for Anushri, an analog synthesizer with a digital drum machine.

Here's a summary of changes in this alternative firmware _compared_ to official Anushri firmware:

* Hi-hat is synthesized in the style of YM3812/OPL2, which means it now sounds more like a lo-fi emulation of an 80's home keyboard, rather than 8-bit sample playback. Note that this free's up some precious memory. 
* Ported 32 step drum nodes for the generative drum sequencer from Grids. 
* Known limitation: 4ppqn clock sync is no longer available (reverts to 8ppqn)
